## Plaintext. Simple.

 txt is just a plaintext editor, and doesn't need to be anything else. The launch screen is nothing but two buttons showing what you can do.

 The editor hides away as much as possible to keep your content front and center.

## Beautiful interface.
 
 Built for the ground up for iOS 13, txt takes advantage of both SF Symbols and the new card-based forms for an amazing, native-feeling user interface.
